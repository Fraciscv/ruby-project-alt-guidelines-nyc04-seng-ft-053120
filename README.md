# `Welcome to HUHU, `
Having trouble getting the green light on those labs?
Join our multipurpose app / movement.
  ## Things it can do.
  - Allows you to write reviews on applications and read other users reviews.
  - Has a joke function which lets you search for jokes by genre **i.e.** _Coding jokes, Chuck Norris Jokes._
  - Edit your profile using our handy dandy editing tab.
  - It does anything and everything, you just have to imagine it, code it in and it might work. 

## Our Story
During the Pandemic of 2020 Netaly and Francisco were involved in a coding Bootcamp which changed their lives IV ever!!!  One warm evening, in Netaly's Garage, while they were getting ready to crack open a 24 case of Coronas.  They discussed the idea for an app, which would help them take over the world.

"We had to start somewhere ... jokes and lessons were what we agreed on." Francisco

"This never happened" Netaly





### Reviews:

  - ##### "Thanks to lesson review I went from 60% lesson completion to 100% completion and understanding of the subjects." Dr. Onut

  - ##### "I was Teflon, now everything sticks" K.Rem

  - ##### "I enjoyed the jokes, they cheered me up and got me to finish all my labs" BB


## How to install:
1. download the repository
2. open it up on the terminal and go into the directory(if you are below the age of 18 consult your parents or guardians on how to do this...  or google it.)
3. type in the following command into the terminal.
    - `rake db:migrate`  -  this will generate a connection between the Classes and the Database.

****_Whatever YOU DO, do not touch the SCHEMA!_**

4. you are ready to run the app, type this in into the terminal and it should load your HUHU.app

## How to use:
- use the arrow keys to move up and down.
- Register if it's your first time using the app. If you accidentally click on log in, use the super-secret command `CONTROL + C`  to exit out of the app.
- try using a username that already exists, the app will generate prompt you to try a different name and might suggest some good user names for you to try.
-update your profile by scrolling through the easy prompts.
