# `Welcome to HUHU, `
Having trouble getting the green light on those labs?
Join our multipurpose app / movement.
  ## Things it can do.
  - Allows you to write reviews on applications and read other users reviews.
  - Has a joke function which lets you search for jokes by genre **i.e.** _Coding jokes, Chuck Norris Jokes._
  - Edit your profile using our handy dandy editing tab.
  - It does anything and everything, you just have to imagine it, code it in and it might work. 

## Our Story
During the Pandemic of 2020 Netaly and Francisco were involved in a coding Bootcamp which changed their lives IV ever!!!  On a warn evening in Netaly's Garage, while they were getting ready to crack open a 24 case of Coronas.  They discused an idea for an app, which would help them take over the world.

"We had to start somewhere and jokes and lessons was what we agreed on." Francisco

"This never happened" Netaly





### Reviews:

  - ##### "Thanks to lesson review I went from 60% lesson completion to 100% completion and understanding of the subjects." Dr. Onut

  - ##### "I was Teflon, now everything sticks" K.Rem

  - ##### "I enjoyed the jokes, they cheered me up and got me to finish all my labs" BB


## How to install:
1. download the repository
2. open it up on the terminal and go into directory(if you are below the age of 18 consult your parents or guardians on how to do this...  or google it.)
3. type in the following command into the terminal.
    - `rake db:migrate`  -  this will generate a connection between the Classes and the Database.
    - `rake db:migrate:status`  -  this will check the status of your migration.  it shold look like this.
    ![success](/Photos/migration_success.png)
    - `rake db:seed`  - this will create random seed data for the app to work.(it shouldn't give you any errors.)

****_Whaterver YOU DO, do not, touch the SCHEMA!_**

4. you are ready to run the app, type this in and it should load your HUHU.app
  -  `ruby bin/run.rb`

                                **VOILA!!**

## How to use:
- use the arrow keys to move up and down.
- Register if it's your first time using the app. If you accidentally click on log in, use the super secret command `CONTROL + C`  to exit out of the app.
- try using a username which already exists, the app will generate prompt you to try a different name and might suggest some good user names for you to try.
-update your profile by scrolling through the easy prompts.

- find lessons you might need help with using the `Seeking Knowledge` option.  Write a lab review! 

    * The video should:
      * Have an overview of your project. (2 minutes max)
* Prepare a presentation to follow your video. (3 minutes max)
    * Your presentation should:
      * Describe something you struggled to build, and show us how you ultimately implemented it in your code.
      * Discuss 3 things you learned in the process of working on this project.
      * Address, if anything, what you would change or add to what you have today?
      * Present any code you would like to highlight.
* Write a blog post about the project and process.
